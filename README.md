Completed: 22/09/22
&nbsp;

## What is This Project?
It is a very basic to-do list webapp with the ability to:
- Add new tasts
- Cross tasks off to mark them as complete
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
&nbsp;

## Issues I Encountered
It was fairly straightforward. I enjoyed the process and didn't come up against anything of note really.
